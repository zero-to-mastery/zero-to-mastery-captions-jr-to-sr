WEBVTT

00:01.080 --> 00:02.010
Welcome back.

00:02.070 --> 00:06.840
It's time for us to actually implement continuous integration into our project.

00:06.870 --> 00:11.460
We're going to be using circle C.I. and we're going to learn a few tricks along the way and we're going

00:11.460 --> 00:14.480
to set this up all ourselves so let's get started.

00:16.260 --> 00:22.980
Now we're going to be using circle C.I. which manages the server for us.

00:22.980 --> 00:29.930
So they own the servers and we simply are using their service to run some tests for our project.

00:31.180 --> 00:36.210
Now circle C.I. is actually free for a simple project like ours.

00:36.220 --> 00:41.530
So you're more than welcome to follow along and implement circle C.I. into your projects.

00:41.710 --> 00:48.490
If you're ever working on anything in teams I do recommend that use them because they're just very nice

00:48.490 --> 00:55.810
and simple to use and only need to do is click on Explore the docs and just a heads up that they recently

00:55.810 --> 01:00.280
upgraded to a 2.0 version that uses daquiri containers.

01:00.280 --> 01:05.770
So just a heads up that for your documentation we want to make sure we use the latest.

01:05.770 --> 01:09.280
A lot has changed since the 1.0 release.

01:09.290 --> 01:12.350
All right let's talk about some of the things that we'll be doing.

01:12.710 --> 01:14.600
Well we have our robo friends up.

01:14.630 --> 01:15.610
Remember them.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.980
And well this simple app still works.

01:18.980 --> 01:20.180
Everything is good.

01:20.360 --> 01:25.250
But Bruno has asked us to implement continuous integration into this project.

01:25.520 --> 01:31.590
Now using this repository we're going to try and include circle see-I on here.

01:31.670 --> 01:37.010
So every time there's a new poll request circle C.I. We'll run through everything and make sure that

01:37.340 --> 01:39.620
it's even ready to be merged.

01:39.860 --> 01:46.110
So let's get started with the circle C.I. so that we can implement it into our project.

01:47.210 --> 01:50.180
Now circle C.I. uses a YAML file.

01:50.180 --> 01:57.940
Something that we have seen before with Dharker as was when we worked with AWOS lambda and it uses a

01:57.940 --> 02:04.110
YAML files to indemnify how you want your testing environment set up and what tests you want to run.

02:04.150 --> 02:05.580
So let's build it first.

02:05.590 --> 02:12.730
The first thing we want to do is we want to create a new folder in our in the root of our project and

02:12.730 --> 02:24.490
by default we have to name it circle S.I. with a dot in front of it and that's because on any machine

02:24.820 --> 02:31.930
such as Mac Linux or Windows files or folder whose names have a dot in front of it our cold system files

02:31.990 --> 02:35.610
and they're automatically hit him by default users.

02:35.620 --> 02:40.770
But this is a standard that circle see-I requires to have for their 2.0 version.

02:40.990 --> 02:49.250
And here we create a new file and this file will have to be called config dot YAML file.

02:49.500 --> 02:56.670
And this is where we will configure what we want circle see-I servers to run for us to get things started.

02:56.740 --> 03:04.620
So let's just do a simple YAML file that circle C I can run and just a heads up in case you're wondering

03:04.710 --> 03:06.590
where you can find more information.

03:06.690 --> 03:08.810
Well obviously if you scroll down.

03:08.850 --> 03:15.400
They have great documentation of what you can do let's just copy and paste some of their examples here

03:16.590 --> 03:20.390
and paste that into our config YAML file.

03:20.460 --> 03:24.730
We see that we're defining our version in our case we're using circle CO2.

03:24.760 --> 03:28.350
So we need version 2 and then we define jobs.

03:28.380 --> 03:29.910
What we want.

03:29.910 --> 03:39.650
The server that they have to do well we wanted to do a build and this build will have a darker image.

03:39.650 --> 03:44.930
Remember I said version 2 of circle C.I. uses docker and we know all about that because we learned about

03:44.930 --> 03:52.490
it in our docker section what circle C.I. is doing is it's creating an image where it can run our test

03:52.880 --> 04:00.170
and we can see here that they're using docker hub and they have a custom image called Circle C.I. and

04:00.170 --> 04:05.930
it looks like they're using Ruby as the container to run our tests.

04:05.930 --> 04:09.740
Now this doesn't have to be node or anything javascript's specific.

04:09.740 --> 04:12.520
This is just the environment that the test will be running in.

04:12.710 --> 04:20.700
And you can see that that is their custom image so circle có is going to use this container to create

04:20.700 --> 04:22.640
the environment for your tests.

04:22.740 --> 04:28.710
And then we have steps of why we need to do and we see over here that run simply says to echo a first

04:28.710 --> 04:33.580
hello and that is just to print out a first hello to our project.

04:33.730 --> 04:44.020
Now for us to implement circle C.I. we need to go to Sign-Up and then here you simply have to click

04:44.140 --> 04:52.300
sign up with get help and once you do that you'll be able to connect to your get Haab dashboard and

04:52.300 --> 04:58.730
you see over here that I already have some past projects already running and these are all my continuous

04:58.760 --> 05:00.800
integration steps.

05:00.800 --> 05:07.250
But for now if this is your first time you might have to give access to circle C.I. from your get have

05:07.250 --> 05:07.650
a account.

05:07.670 --> 05:11.610
Otherwise you should see an empty build's dashboard.

05:11.660 --> 05:17.300
The next thing we want to do is actually add a project we want to make sure we add our robot friends

05:17.420 --> 05:20.960
testing repo so that circle C.I. knows about it.

05:20.960 --> 05:27.140
I'm going to click add projects and in here look at that I have all my repots listed here.

05:27.140 --> 05:36.170
I'm going to click on Roble friends testing setup project see that and here we get some default things

05:36.170 --> 05:37.070
that we should be using.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.410
Or we can change things.

05:38.630 --> 05:44.970
For example our project will have different operating systems we can use different languages.

05:46.330 --> 05:53.500
I recommend that you just leave the default on our project as node and we can just have a Linux operating

05:53.500 --> 05:58.510
system and then it shows you what the next steps are going to be.

05:58.890 --> 06:03.270
But we're going to ignore all of that and leave everything as it is now.

06:04.040 --> 06:07.100
You can see over here that they even give you a sample file they can use.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.360
They make it very very easy to get started.

06:09.380 --> 06:18.940
I'm just going to click Start building and see right away that my robo friends app starts building.

06:18.940 --> 06:20.360
Everything is all set up.

06:24.950 --> 06:30.950
And now the container you can see start container is going to run through some commands automatically.

06:30.950 --> 06:43.530
So this is running on their servers on my robot rebel friends testing Ribault.

06:43.540 --> 06:44.090
All right.

06:44.110 --> 06:50.270
I had to pause the video there because it does take a bit of time for circle CII to actually run everything.

06:50.530 --> 06:53.810
You can see that it took about five minutes to get everything done.

06:53.860 --> 06:56.100
But let's take a look at what it just did.

06:56.230 --> 06:59.630
We actually haven't even given it the config YAML for.

06:59.650 --> 07:04.980
Because remember this is just on my desktop and I haven't committed it to get help yet.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.000
We go back.

07:06.130 --> 07:12.340
We see that there's a few things that happened with circle see-I without even giving it the yellow fall

07:12.370 --> 07:13.400
for configuration.

07:14.600 --> 07:24.300
We see that we're able to set up the environment it use the circle see-I Ruby to point four point one

07:24.570 --> 07:28.460
image that we saw to launch an environment for us.

07:28.560 --> 07:32.880
We can see over here and start container all the things that it did.

07:32.910 --> 07:36.100
It also has enabled S-sh.

07:36.510 --> 07:41.680
As you remember from the SSA section we can now use S-sh.

07:41.820 --> 07:49.680
Look over here to actually S-sh into this container and see how everything's going maybe we need to

07:49.680 --> 07:57.450
debug something we can S-sh in again something that we'll have to actually add to our public key to

07:57.450 --> 07:58.910
the container if we want to do that.

07:58.920 --> 08:04.100
And that's a little advanced and the can read up on your own but that option exists which is nice.

08:04.410 --> 08:10.410
And then we do something called checking out the code which is circle see-I check so your get Haab repository

08:10.860 --> 08:12.200
and clone's it.

08:12.270 --> 08:18.880
You can see over here Colon's the full repository and actually run us through some steps by default.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.400
It runs NPM install it runs NPM test.

08:23.400 --> 08:29.370
If we click over here we see that our tests that we have on our project are Wrubel France project.

08:29.430 --> 08:38.900
There are 16 Tests five snapshots all of them passed and we keep scrolling down and everything finishes

08:39.050 --> 08:39.680
completely.

08:39.680 --> 08:44.330
We have green everywhere and it says success.

08:44.420 --> 08:52.170
If I go back to the builds we see that our robot friends testing and Master is now passing with success.

08:52.170 --> 08:58.740
Now let's actually add a bit more functionality than the default functionality we get which is just

08:58.740 --> 09:03.960
running NPM install and NPM test just to spice things up.

09:04.150 --> 09:06.140
Let's extend this a little bit.

09:06.160 --> 09:10.300
Right now we see that we're going to do a build in create a docker container.

09:10.330 --> 09:14.100
We're going to check out the code and run Ecko a first hello.

09:14.110 --> 09:21.310
This is just going to print this text but circle C.I. has this idea of workflows so I can actually add

09:21.850 --> 09:22.630
another step

09:25.920 --> 09:27.880
or perhaps a now they're built.

09:28.230 --> 09:30.040
So that is another container.

09:30.880 --> 09:39.580
And this container again I can just keep everything the same but this one I'm going to say double trouble

09:41.120 --> 09:44.840
to be right we actually now need to rename these.

09:44.860 --> 09:49.270
And this is what workflows is in circle C.I. so that we can distinguish them.

09:49.270 --> 09:53.050
So let's just say this one's going to be Bobby.

09:53.440 --> 10:03.550
This is going to be Sally and now using these two I can define what we call a workflow or workflows

10:05.460 --> 10:11.280
and and here we simply say again what version we want to use the workflow for and we can name it whatever

10:11.280 --> 10:11.760
we want.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.940
I'm going to name it.

10:13.030 --> 10:22.710
Bobby underscore Sally because we're going to be writing both of them and these will have jobs that

10:22.710 --> 10:24.210
they would need to accomplish.

10:25.330 --> 10:32.030
And these jobs are going to be the Babi job.

10:32.210 --> 10:33.750
Make sure I add a space here.

10:36.110 --> 10:46.290
And Sally so this workflow is going to say hey run this workflow Bobby and Sally and those include these

10:46.290 --> 10:46.710
things.

10:46.710 --> 10:51.560
So run two containers running the checkout and then run echo command.

10:52.050 --> 10:54.840
Let's just save this to make sure everything works.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.790
We have our circle see-I config file.

10:57.870 --> 11:06.420
Let's actually add this to get up to that circle see-I has a configure file to actually play with.

11:06.420 --> 11:18.670
I'm going to get ad and then get commit I'm going to add circle C.I. to our commit message.

11:18.860 --> 11:22.950
And then finally get push origin master.

11:22.970 --> 11:29.930
Now I'm using maß and I haven't created a branch or for this project which is not advised but for demonstration

11:29.930 --> 11:34.390
purposes for now I trust myself as just me on this project.

11:34.400 --> 11:38.110
I'm just going to push straight to master.

11:38.130 --> 11:47.260
All right let's go back to get how oh we have four seconds ago something that already failed.

11:47.260 --> 11:50.110
All right let's go back to get up and see what happens.

11:50.120 --> 12:01.080
Want to refresh go to commits and oh I see that I have a giant X now next to my commit.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.370
I click on it.

12:03.390 --> 12:03.780
All right.

12:03.780 --> 12:10.000
We've committed our config done YAML file and I go back here and I click on failed.

12:10.380 --> 12:15.500
I see that your config has errors and may not run correctly.

12:15.510 --> 12:16.040
Awesome.

12:16.140 --> 12:23.760
So I mean that's not great but at least we know that circle C.I. can detect our configuration file and

12:23.760 --> 12:30.690
we see here that it gives a pretty nice air of what might have scale error migrating config to version

12:30.690 --> 12:31.400
2.0.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.490
And the errors occurred in Job workflows.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.840
Steps is not a list.

12:37.930 --> 12:42.040
So let's go back and fix that with a YAML file.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.250
You really have to be careful with indentation.

12:44.270 --> 12:49.690
So anytime you're working with YAML files make sure you followed the documentation and what they expect

12:50.050 --> 12:58.840
in this case are indentation needs to be won back like this let's save that once again do our get push

12:59.110 --> 13:01.570
or G.M. although you know what.

13:01.630 --> 13:04.540
Just to demonstrate what circle C.I. actually does.

13:04.540 --> 13:05.860
Let's create a new branch.

13:05.890 --> 13:12.250
I'm going to say get checkout be for short hand to create a new branch and I'm going to call it circle

13:12.520 --> 13:14.600
C.I..

13:14.620 --> 13:15.120
All right.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.450
We've created a new branch.

13:16.450 --> 13:23.410
If I do get status I see that we have our config YAML file that's been updated.

13:23.410 --> 13:32.530
I'm going to say get commit I'm going to commit circle see-I to this is our try to.

13:33.060 --> 13:35.760
And then I'm going to get push

13:38.300 --> 13:41.260
origin Circle C.

13:41.460 --> 13:43.600
So push to our branch

13:47.260 --> 13:50.540
and silly me I realized that I forgot to get at.

13:50.700 --> 13:51.420
Try that again.

13:51.420 --> 13:56.640
Get ad get commit circle see-I to.

13:56.640 --> 13:57.150
There you go.

13:57.150 --> 13:58.260
That's a lot better.

13:58.320 --> 14:05.970
And then you'll run get push origin circle C.I..

14:05.970 --> 14:08.580
All right let's go check out get help here.

14:08.580 --> 14:10.650
All right we have a request.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.420
Let's take a look at here.

14:14.390 --> 14:15.990
First everything looks good.

14:15.990 --> 14:17.830
Those are the changes that I want.

14:18.000 --> 14:25.900
I'm going to just with our commentary and just say create pull requests and look at that circle C.I.

14:25.900 --> 14:29.380
is now running all my poor requests just like that.

14:29.470 --> 14:32.460
We see that your test passed on Sally.

14:32.590 --> 14:35.410
But Bauby right now is still working.

14:35.410 --> 14:39.010
So it's half done how easy was that.

14:39.260 --> 14:42.800
And once all the checks have passed I get these green check marks.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.170
And now it's ready to merge requests.

14:46.170 --> 14:48.060
Well let's go check out circle C.I. here.

14:48.080 --> 14:51.800
I'm going to go back to Bill's and we see that.

14:51.860 --> 14:53.870
Oh yeah look at that.

14:53.870 --> 14:55.590
We have a success.

14:55.820 --> 14:58.970
We've spun up the environment.

14:59.070 --> 15:01.410
We've checked out the code.

15:01.530 --> 15:02.710
That's great.

15:02.820 --> 15:06.350
And we also have the echo.

15:06.380 --> 15:09.290
Double trouble.

15:09.700 --> 15:14.030
If we go back here we see that we did double trouble here with the echo.

15:14.170 --> 15:18.060
But what about a first hello by Bobbie.

15:18.340 --> 15:26.890
If we go back we actually see that there were two jobs.

15:26.990 --> 15:34.910
If I go to click on Bobby Sally workflow we see that oh there's two jobs in this workflow.

15:35.040 --> 15:39.410
If I click on Bobby I get Bobby Acco hello first.

15:39.460 --> 15:40.650
Okay that's great.

15:40.650 --> 15:44.770
And then if I go back to workflow I see that.

15:44.770 --> 15:45.250
OK.

15:45.370 --> 15:48.900
Sally and Bobby and I see exactly what time it took.

15:48.970 --> 15:53.410
If I go back to build's I see that that's why I have two greens here.

15:53.410 --> 15:58.860
They each ran in their own container very very cool.

15:59.280 --> 16:06.900
And you also noticed that we no longer ran the NPM test for NPM install because we now are giving it

16:06.930 --> 16:11.520
a config file and these config file is going to say exactly what we want it to do.

16:11.550 --> 16:16.620
So now we actually have to implement our own to make sure that we test our code.

16:16.710 --> 16:21.900
We NPM install our code and everything is running smoothly.

16:21.940 --> 16:22.740
All right.

16:22.840 --> 16:27.070
I think it's time for us to actually implement something valuable here.
